## Architecture

### Component Structure

The Thatcher Admin dashboard is built around a modular architecture with clearly separated concerns:

1. **Core Components**:
   - **NftBuilderComponent**: The central page building interface
   - **NftNodeControlComponent**: Controls for manipulating content nodes
   - **NftNodeEditorComponent**: Editing interface for individual content nodes
   - **NftTopControlComponent**: Main toolbar for site-wide actions

2. **Specialized Editors**:
   - **NftPageBuilderComponent**: Editor specific to page content
   - **NftHeaderBuilderComponent**: Editor for site headers
   - **NftFooterBuilderComponent**: Editor for site footers

3. **Node Types and Accordion Panels**:
   - The system uses an extendable component approach with specialized accordion editors for different content types (text, images, columns, CSS, etc.)
   - Each content type is implemented as a dedicated component with specific editing capabilities

### Service Layer

The system employs a comprehensive service architecture:

- **NftBuilderService**: Core service managing the page building functionality
- **NftCommonService**: Shared utilities and state management
- **REST API Services**: Auto-generated from OpenAPI specifications for backend communication
- **AlertService**: User notification system
- **MemoryStorageService**: Client-side storage mechanism

### Data Flow

The application employs a unidirectional data flow pattern:

1. User interactions trigger service methods
2. Services communicate with the backend via the REST API
3. Component state updates through Angular's change detection
4. Visual representation updates to reflect changes

A particularly novel approach is the tree-based node navigation system which allows for efficient traversal and manipulation of deeply nested content structures. This provides both performance benefits and a more intuitive mental model for content administrators.

## Security

The Thatcher Admin dashboard implements multiple layers of security:

1. **Authentication**:
   - JWT-based authentication with secure token storage
   - Automatic redirection to login for unauthorized access attempts
   - Token validation for all API requests via HTTP interceptors

2. **Content Security**:
   - HTML content sanitization using NgDompurify to prevent XSS attacks
   - Secure content validation before saving to the backend

3. **API Security**:
   - Custom REST interceptor managing authentication headers
   - Automatic token inclusion for authorized API requests
   - Comprehensive error handling with user-friendly notifications

4. **File Security**:
   - Cryptographic hash generation for uploaded files
   - Content type validation for uploads
   - Secure handling of binary data

A particularly security-conscious approach is the implementation of automatic sanitization for all HTML content both during editing and display, eliminating the risk of cross-site scripting attacks even when working with rich content.

## Deployment

The Thatcher Admin dashboard is designed for flexible deployment options:

- **Development Mode**: Local development server with hot reloading capabilities
- **Production Builds**: Optimized bundles with ahead-of-time compilation
- **Environment Configuration**: Separate environment files for development and production settings
- **API Endpoint Configuration**: Configurable backend API connection
- **Asset Optimization**: Automatic bundling and minification for production

The system is built to be deployed alongside the backend API service, typically on the same domain to avoid CORS issues, but can be configured for cross-domain deployment when necessary. The production build process ensures optimal performance and security for live deployments.

The architecture supports various hosting options including traditional web servers, containerized deployments, and modern serverless platforms, making it adaptable to diverse infrastructure requirements.

Developed with a focus on usability, security, and performance, the Thatcher Admin dashboard represents a modern approach to content management, combining the power of Angular with intuitive visual editing capabilities.
