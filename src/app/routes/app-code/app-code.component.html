            <h3>Learner Data</h3>
            <p>A backend service application built using the LoopBack 4 framework. It serves as a data integration and

                of learner data between various external systems:

            <p>The application implements increased security measures because it handles personal and sensitive data:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Transient data only</strong>. Data is passed directly between external services, no data is
                    stored in the
                    application</li>
                <li>External credentials are <strong>encrypted at-rest</strong> using AES-256-CBC</li>
                <li>Security by design: encryption keys are intrinsically tied to the host machine's hard disk drive
                    UUID, established during deployment. The <strong>keys are never stored in the application or in
                        environment
                        variables</strong>, they are generated at runtime using the relevant disk drive UUID</li>
                <li><strong>Hardware-binding protection</strong>: if the hard disk changes (either virtual or physical),
                    the connection
                    details cannot be decrypted, preventing unauthorized access in case of disk theft or virtual machine
                    cloning. Eradicates the vulnerabilities of storing keys in environment variables.</li>
                <li>OAuth2 authentication for Google services</li>
                <li>Uses SFTP (SSH File Transfer Protocol) rather than FTP/FTPS where HTTPS is unavailable.</li>

            <h2>Exploring tRPC, ZAP and Zod Output Schemas</h2>
            <p>
                <a href="https://trpc.io/" target="_blank">tRPC</a> is a framework that simplifies API development by
                providing end-to-end type safety between client and server, effectively eliminating the need for
                traditional REST or GraphQL boilerplate and potentially offering a superior developer experience.
            </p>
            <p><a href="https://www.zaproxy.org/" target="_blank">ZAP</a> (OWASP Zed Attack Proxy) is an open-source web
                application security scanner, primarily used for dynamic application security testing.
            </p>
            <p><a href="https://zod.dev/" target="_blank">Zod</a> is a TypeScript-first schema declaration and
                validation library, allowing developers to define data
                shapes with strong type inference.
            </p>
            <p>ZAP can automatically identify security vulnerabilities in REST APIs. However, its ability to
                do so effectively is significantly boosted when it has a highly detailed schema to reference expected
                responses. The schema detail required goes well beyond the scope provided by a standard OpenAPI
                specification.
            </p>
            <p>This is where Zod becomes incredibly powerful. While servers commonly use Zod for validating
                <em>input</em> schemas, implementing Zod for <em>output</em> schemas provides a precise, type-safe
                definition of the data that <em>should</em> be returned by the API. This provides better synergy with
                ZAP, as it can then rigorously validate API responses against an exact specification, catching
                unexpected data, missing fields, or potential data leakage.
            </p>
            <p>
                To tie these two together, tRPC was chosen due to it's potential to transparently provide a single
                interface for both server and client, inherently verified and validated with comprehensive end-to-end
                type safety. This creates <strong>a robust, end-to-end development approach with security intrinsically
                    embedded</strong> throughout the pipeline.
            </p>
            <p>
                While the proof of concept successfully demonstrated the power of this integrated approach, the broader
                adoption and widespread support of both tRPC and automated output schemas (especially those
                generated directly from TypeScript definitions) in popular frameworks remain limited.
