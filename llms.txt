# Chris Turnbull - Software Developer Portfolio

This is the personal portfolio website of Chris Turnbull, a full-stack software developer specializing in TypeScript, Angular, Node.js, and modern web technologies.

## Site Structure

The website is built as an Angular Single Page Application (SPA) with the following main sections:

### Home (/)
Personal introduction and overview of skills and experience.

### Portfolio (/portfolio)
Comprehensive showcase of projects and technical work.

### Application Code (/app-code)
Detailed examples of custom application development including:
- WordPress Plugins with custom roles, admin interfaces, and Divi theme optimizations
- Chrome Extensions for eSchools platform automation with AngularJS
- 3D Digitization & Modeling projects using Realsense D415, PCL C++, and 6D ICP
- Technologies: TypeScript, C++, Emscripten, PHP, Python, WordPress

### Web Development Projects

#### Gateshead Learning and Skills CMS (/ls-cms)
Full-stack content management system featuring:
- **Frontend**: Angular Universal with SSR, security-focused architecture
- **Backend**: LoopBack 4 TypeScript REST API with JWT authentication
- **Admin Dashboard**: Drag-and-drop page builder with component library
- **Security**: DOMPurify sanitization, XSS protection, OWASP compliance
- **Technologies**: TypeScript, LoopBack, Angular, SSR, MySQL, OpenAPI, WCAG, HubSpot, ZAP

#### Gateshead Assessment Profile Web App (/gap)

- **Technologies**: TypeScript, Fastify, Angular, SQLite, Drizzle, Mailjet, Zod, JWT, Tailwind

#### LLM Bitcoin Key Predictor (/llm-bitcoin-demo)
This project is a technical demonstration of running a Large Language Model (LLM) entirely within a web browser, on-device.
- **Purpose**: Showcases browser-side LLM inference using a 500 million parameter Danube3 LLM (4-bit quantized to 318MB GGUF format). The application attempts to predict Bitcoin private keys from public addresses using few-shot prompting.
- **Functionality**: The LLM runs locally in the browser via WebAssembly (llama.cpp compiled with Emscripten), with the UI built using Angular and Tailwind CSS.
- **Key Insight**: While impressive for its on-device execution, the project explicitly highlights that the LLM *cannot* genuinely predict private keys. Bitcoin's cryptographic design ensures no predictable patterns exist between addresses and keys for an LLM to learn, making it inherently unpredictable.
- **Demonstration Goal**: To illustrate that LLMs can generate plausible-looking text even for data without underlying patterns, and to prove the viability of complex LLM operations directly within a web browser, maintaining a responsive user interface.
- **Technologies**: Danube3 LLM, GGUF, llama.cpp, Emscripten, WebAssembly, Angular, Tailwind CSS, IndexedDB.
